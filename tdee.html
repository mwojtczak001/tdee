        <h1>Woj's Weight Loss Crash Course -- FAQ</h1>
        <div class="faq-question-container">
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h2>What is TDEE?</h2>
            <p>TDEE is your "Total Daily Energy Expendeture", which is the amount of calories your body burns in a day.  This number will change based on your activity level on the given day (working, exercising, walking, etc) along with other factors such as age, sex, height, and weight.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h2>How do I figure out my TDEE?</h2>
            <p>There are many TDEE calculators online (I've linked one on the left sidebar).  However, these are just estimates based on overall population statistics.  They are a good starting point, but you will need to figure your own out via trial and error.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h2>How do I lose weight?</h2>
            <p>To lose 1 pound in a week, you need to have a total weekly caloric defecit of about 3,500 calories.  This equates to a daily caloric defecit of 500 (of your TDEE).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h2>What happens when I'm in a caloric defecit?</h2>
            <p>When you eat in a calorie defecit, your body burns fat as well as muscle.  To minimize muscle loss while cutting, first you want to ensure that your defecit is not too aggressive.  Assuming you do not have a ton of weight to lose, a good conservative defecit is anywhere between 0.5 and 1.5 pounds per week (-250 to -750 calorie defecit per day).</p>
            <p class="padding-top">Another way to limit muscle loss is via adequete protein intake and exercise.  A good estimate for how much protein to eat is 80% of your total body weight.  For example, a 170 pound person would eat 170x0.8= <span class="bold">136g of protein</span> per day.  Ideally, progressive overload weight training should be done to limit muscle loss.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h2>How should I track my calories?</h2>
            <p>If you are serious about weight loss and want to be as effecient as possible, the best method to accomplish this is via calorie counting.  A popular calorie tracking app is MyFitnessPal, which is linked on the left sidebar.  This app is also useful to track macronutrients (<span class="bold">proteins</span>, carbs, fats)</p>
            <p class="padding-top">In general, people grossly overestimate how much they are actually eating, which is why a digital food scale (linked left as well) is a very important tool to very accurately track your daily caloric intake.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h2>How do I know if it's working?</h2>
            <p>Weigh yourself daily.  Note that your body weight fluctuates naturally on a daily (or even hourly) basis.  Ignore the day-to-day numbers.  Instead, download a weight-tracking app (Libra for Android or Happy Scale for iOS are great, both linked left).  Plot your weight and look at your weight loss <span class="bold">TREND</span> over a longer period of time (3-4+ weeks).</span></p>
          </div>
          <div class="libra-example-container">
            <img class="libra-example-image" alt="libra trending weight image example" src="libraexample.PNG">
            <p>Looking at this image, each dot represents an individual weight on a given day.  The line is the trend of the weight loss.  Looking at November 2020, the trend started at 210.0 and ended at around 204.0. Divide 6 by 4.2 weeks and this means that the rate of loss is about 1.43 pounds per week.  Use this long-term data to compare to what your actual goal was.  If my goal was 1 pound per week, I know that I overshot by a bit and was in a bigger defecit than intended. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h2>What do I do if my trend does not match my goal?</h2>
            <p>If you are not losing as much weight as expected, there are three common things that could be at play:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You are over-estimating your calories burned from excerise (fitness equipment generally grossly overestimates the actual number burned)</li>
                <li>
                  You are under-estimating how many calories you're eating.  If you're not weighing your food using a digital scale, this is very likely to be happening, and it can happen even if you do weigh food
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your actual TDEE is a bit off and may need a slight adjustment
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This can be tricky as there are three variables.  This is why calorie tracking is very important, because if you are very precice with weighing food and counting calories, it's easier to make adjustments to the other variables.</p>
